👋 Hi, I'm **Siqiao Xie** (谢斯峤), I am a computational social scientist and population geographer. I'm passionate about understanding how technological advancements and regional developments influence social and economic inequalities and population health across regions and communities. My work spans three main themes:

### 🌍 High Tech, Regional Development & Migration
I investigate how today's knowledge-based economy shapes migration, regional development, and inequalities. My research focuses on disparities in STEM fields, looking at gender and nativity-based challenges in "superstar" regions and beyond. Through this work, I aim to contribute to policies that promote equitable urban, migration, and labor outcomes.

### 📊 Tracking People & Places Over Time
I also develop innovative methods and datasets to track people and places through time, using advanced statistical, GIScience, and machine-learning techniques. This approach allows me to explore the spatial dynamics of inequality, social mobility, and population health, providing critical insights that guide public policy and improve community well-being.

### 🏥 Population Health & Policy Impact beyond the academia
My research sits at the intersection of place, inequality, and population health, drawing on federal health policy and community initiatives. Through my work with SPHERE and COVID-19 projects, I developed spatial analytic approaches to identify vulnerable communities and assess health disparities. This work translated into actionable policy insights for CMS, CDC, and NGO initiatives, strengthening resilience and funding for minority communities.

🔗 Feel free to explore my [ongoing projects](./publications.html), [datasets](./portfolio.html), and [background](./files/xie_cv_new.pdf)! Let's connect and talk about how data, geography, and spatial analysis can drive meaningful change.
