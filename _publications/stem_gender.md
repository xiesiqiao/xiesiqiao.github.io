excerpt: 'This paper examines income inequality within STEM occupations in the U.S., focusing on nativity- and gender-based disparities. It finds that despite accounting for factors like education and labor market contexts, women—particularly foreign-born women—continue to earn significantly less than men, highlighting persistent gender inequities in high-paying STEM fields.'

Income inequality in the United States is at an all-time high. The rise of inequality between people and places is being fueled by technological changes that heavily favor workers with college degrees, particularly those in fields related to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). But among workers in these leading technological sectors, who exactly is reaping the rewards? We answer this question through detailed analysis of nativity- and gender-based income disparities within STEM occupations, areas of work known to be disproportionately male and foreign born. After establishing that women earn around 15 percent less than men in STEM, we attempt to explain the income differentials in STEM through differences in the educational attainment, labor-force participation, occupational holding, and labor market contexts of US- and foreign-born, men and women. Contrary to expectations, we find that these adjustments actually widen the income deficit for women in STEM, and particularly so for foreign-born women. Women do earn significantly more when employed in the leading STEM labor markets, but the earnings gap relative to men is remarkably persistent across locations. Our findings confirm that the growth of the STEM work favors men, not only because they are more likely to work in these high-paying occupations, but because they also tend to get paid more within these occupations.
