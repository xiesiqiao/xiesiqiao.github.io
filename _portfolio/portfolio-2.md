## 100m Population Grid (2020 Census)

**Summary.** A high-resolution (**100m Ã— 100m**) population distribution dataset for the United States built from **2020 Census** counts. Population is allocated to fine grid cells using methods inspired by Zhang & Zhao (2020), enabling sub-county analysis across states and regions. Distributed as state-level GeoTIFFs in **EPSG:5070** (NAD83 / Conus Albers).

**Formats.** GeoTIFF rasters by state (EPSG:5070).
