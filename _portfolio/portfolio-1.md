## Crosswalks between Commuting Zones and Historical Geographies (1990â€“2020)

**Summary.** Using a high-resolution 100m Ã— 100m population distribution grid (derived from the 2020 Census), these population-weighted crosswalks link **2020 Commuting Zones (CZ20)** and **2020 PUMAs** to historical geographies: **1990 commuting zones**, **2000 & 2010 ERS commuting zones**, and **2010 & 2020 PUMAs**. Each CSV reports overlaps, shares, and totals to reallocate data consistently between geographies across timeâ€”preserving national totals and supporting longitudinal analysis of labor markets and communities.

**Formats.** CSV crosswalk tables (population overlaps, shares, totals).

## 100m Population Grid (2020 Census)

**Summary.** A high-resolution (**100m Ã— 100m**) population distribution dataset for the United States built from **2020 Census** counts. Population is allocated to fine grid cells using methods inspired by Zhang & Zhao (2020), enabling sub-county analysis across states and regions. Distributed as state-level GeoTIFFs in **EPSG:5070** (NAD83 / Conus Albers).

**Formats.** GeoTIFF rasters by state (EPSG:5070).

## GEO-NSCG 2021 5-Year Estimates

**Summary.** Derived from the **2021 National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG)** with imputed geographic data for finer spatial context. Includes the **foreign-born sample** with probability-based location assignments and imputed **MSAs**, enabling geographically disaggregated analysis of foreign education experience and the spatial distribution of highly skilled immigrants. Supports research on regional settlement patterns and socioeconomic outcomes of foreign-born STEM workers.

**Formats.** Microdata with imputed locations and MSAs; documentation.
