## Crosswalks between Commuting Zones and Historical Geographies (1990â€“2020)

**Summary.** Using a high-resolution 100m Ã— 100m population distribution grid (derived from the 2020 Census), these population-weighted crosswalks link **2020 Commuting Zones (CZ20)** and **2020 PUMAs** to historical geographies: **1990 commuting zones**, **2000 & 2010 ERS commuting zones**, and **2010 & 2020 PUMAs**. Each CSV reports overlaps, shares, and totals to reallocate data consistently between geographies across timeâ€”preserving national totals and supporting longitudinal analysis of labor markets and communities.

**Formats.** CSV crosswalk tables (population overlaps, shares, totals).
