### GEO-NSCG 2020 5-Year Estimates

This dataset is derived from the 2020 National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG), with imputed geographic data to provide a more detailed spatial context. It includes the foreign-born sample, with probability-based location assignments and imputed Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), offering valuable insights into the spatial distribution of highly skilled immigrants in the United States.

The dataset is used to explore the regional settlement patterns and socioeconomic outcomes of foreign-born STEM workers, enabling more granular analysis of migration and regional development.
