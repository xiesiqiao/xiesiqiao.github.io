Hi—I'm **Siqiao** (谢斯峤). I am a computational social scientist and population geographer. I study how **neighborhoods**—their built form, infrastructure, and socioeconomic conditions—shape **population health**. I build **longitudinal, neighborhood-level datasets** and **GIS/Machine-Learning** pipelines so we can **track change over time**, explain **health–place links**, and turn analysis into action. 

### 🏥 Neighborhood health, built from the block up
I build **neighborhood-scale, longitudinal data systems**—harmonized small-area units, crosswalks, and indicators that let us follow *places and people* across years. Using GIS, Machine-Learning, remote sensing, and administrative statistics, I connect built form, infrastructure, and socio-economic conditions to **population health** across the life course (midlife mortality, mental health, and healthy longevity). The goal is simple: see how place makes people **vulnerable or resilient**, track change with clarity, and evaluate which targeted local actions.

### 🔄 From GeoHealth research to action
I work across universities, public agencies, NGOs, and the private sector to **turn analysis into decisions**. With partners on federal health policy and community initiatives (e.g., SPHERE and COVID-19 projects), I’ve used spatial analytics to identify vulnerable communities, quantify disparities, and support targeted responses. This collaboration model—co-produced questions, transparent methods, **decision-ready briefs, maps, and dashboards**—helps funders and practitioners act quickly and credibly, and leaves behind open resources others can build on.

### 🌍 High-Tech, Regional Development & Migration
A second strand of my work examines how today’s knowledge economy shapes **migration, regional development, and inequality**. I study disparities in STEM and in “superstar” regions—by gender and nativity—and aim to inform policies that widen opportunity and make growth more inclusive.
