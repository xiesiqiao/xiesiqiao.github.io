## GEO-NSCG 2021 5-Year Estimates

**Summary.** Derived from the **2021 National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG)** with imputed geographic data for finer spatial context. Includes the **foreign-born sample** with probability-based location assignments and imputed **MSAs**, enabling geographically disaggregated analysis of foreign education experience and the spatial distribution of highly skilled immigrants. Supports research on regional settlement patterns and socioeconomic outcomes of foreign-born STEM workers.

**Formats.** Microdata with imputed locations and MSAs; documentation.
