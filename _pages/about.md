👋 **Welcome to my Academic Website!**

Hi, I'm **Siqiao Xie** (谢斯峤), a Postdoctoral Associate at the Institute of Behavioral Science, University of Colorado, Boulder. I recently earned my PhD in Geography from Arizona State University, where I explored the geography of inequality in STEM—focusing on migration, gender, and economic disparities.

I am passionate about understanding how technological advancements and regional developments influence social and economic inequalities across regions and communities. My work spans two main themes:

### 🌍 Regional Development, High Tech & Migration
I investigate how today's knowledge-based economy shapes migration, regional development, and inequalities. My research focuses on disparities in STEM fields, looking at gender and nativity-based challenges in "superstar" regions and beyond. Through this work, I aim to contribute to policies that promote equitable urban, migration, and labor outcomes.

### 📊 Tracking People & Places Over Time
I also develop innovative methods and datasets to track people and places through time, using advanced statistical, GIScience, and machine-learning techniques. This approach allows me to explore the spatial dynamics of inequality, social mobility, and population health, providing critical insights that guide public policy and improve community well-being.

🔗 Feel free to explore my [ongoing projects](./publication.html), [datasets](./portfolio.html), and [background](./files/xie_cv_new.pdf)! Let's connect and talk about how data, geography, and spatial analysis can drive meaningful change.
